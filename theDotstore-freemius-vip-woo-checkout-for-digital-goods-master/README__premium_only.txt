* Quick Checkout Button display on the Shop page
* Quick Checkout Button display on the Product Details page
* Enable or disable exclude order note on checkout 
* Quick Checkout for all downloadable and/or virtual products

= Benefits of Using this Plugin: =

* Significant Decrease in Time Taken in Checkout

With the lesser amount of information to fill and only essential steps to be taken for checkout, you reduce the time taken in the checkout process by your customers to a bare minimum. Sure, it will make them happy!

* Lesser Frustration and Easy Checkout

Though physical product deliveries require a significant amount of data from the customer, things are not the same in the case of digital products. So, just ask for information that is necessary and let the buyers download/use the product.

* Reduced Cart Abandonment Rate

By putting dozens of information fields on checkout form for digital products, you’re just making sure that your buyer gets frustrated and discards the process. Do not do that. Reduce their hassles and avoid order abandoning.

* Increased Sales of your Digital Goods

Quick checkouts and better user experience encourage people to purchase digital goods from you. So whenever you are selling a virtual or downloadable product, do not push your buyers to follow the same process as physical products.
